DataFrame and DataMatrix
************************

Basics
------

.. currentmodule:: pandas

**DataFrame** is a both 2D-matrix- and dict-like object implementing a
named collection of identically-indexed Series objects. There is
another important class called **DataMatrix** which has almost
identical behavior to DataFrame, differing only in the internal
implementation. Rather than create confusion, we will focus on
DataFrame for this guide and explain later why to use one over the
other depending on your application.

.. note::

    Unlike Series, neither DataFrame nor DataMatrix is a subclass of
    numpy.ndarray.

For many users, DataFrame / DataMatrix is the most commonly used
object in pandas, as it can serve as the primary container for a full
data set of interest. As we will see below, it enables operations
involving multiple time series or cross sections with ease.

The canonical DataFrame containing time series data takes this form,
which will be used for many examples to follow:

::

    >>> from pandas import *; from numpy.random import randn

    >>> index = DateRange('1/1/2009', '12/1/2009', timeRule='EOM')
    >>> N = len(index)
    >>> data = {
	'A' : randn(N),
	'B' : randn(N),
	'C' : randn(N),
    }

    >>> df = DataFrame(data, index=index)

    >>> print df

			   A              B              C
    2009-01-30 00:00:00    -0.367014      1.29942        1.40773
    2009-02-27 00:00:00    0.347326       0.651661       0.143376
    2009-03-31 00:00:00    -0.677813      0.40488        -0.463113
    2009-04-30 00:00:00    0.125062       1.09505        -1.03278
    2009-05-29 00:00:00    0.979307       0.149356       0.708128
    2009-06-30 00:00:00    -1.24432       0.420788       -1.01815
    2009-07-31 00:00:00    0.536261       -0.276357      -0.227469
    2009-08-31 00:00:00    0.0603968      -1.42112       -0.271767
    2009-09-30 00:00:00    0.537841       -0.361833      -0.0488729
    2009-10-30 00:00:00    -0.335999      2.54742        -0.878263
    2009-11-30 00:00:00    -0.568216      -0.557347      -1.58623

The **info** method provides a summary of a DataFrame object and will
be printed by default when the frame is very large:

::

    >>> df.info()
    Index: 11 entries, 2009-01-30 00:00:00 to 2009-11-30 00:00:00
    Columns:
    A    11  non-null values
    B    11  non-null values
    C    11  non-null values

The DataFrame's index and columns can be accessed by the **index**
attribute and **cols** method, respectively:

::

    >>> df.index
    Index([2009-01-30 00:00:00, 2009-02-27 00:00:00, 2009-03-31 00:00:00,
	   2009-04-30 00:00:00, 2009-05-29 00:00:00, 2009-06-30 00:00:00,
	   2009-07-31 00:00:00, 2009-08-31 00:00:00, 2009-09-30 00:00:00,
	   2009-10-30 00:00:00, 2009-11-30 00:00:00], dtype=object)

    >>> df.cols()
    ['A', 'B', 'C']


.. autosummary::
   :toctree: generated/

   DataFrame.cols
   DataFrame.info

Construction
------------

There are several ways to create a DataFrame:

   * From a dict of ndarrays or Series
   * From a 2D ndarray and arrays of index and column names
   * From a NumPy structured (record) array
   * From a nested dictionary

.. autosummary::
   :toctree: generated/

   DataFrame
   DataFrame.fromDict
   DataFrame.fromMatrix
   DataFrame.fromRecords

Indexing
--------

.. note::

    I have eschewed "cute" indexing schemes in the interest of being
    explicit and maintaining DataFrame's status as a "dict of
    Series". However, it is always desirable to keep the interface
    simple and intuitive.


DataFrame's basic indexing accesses the **columns** by name, producing
Series:

::

    >>> df['A']
    2009-01-30 00:00:00    -0.367013536107
    2009-02-27 00:00:00    0.347325830717
    2009-03-31 00:00:00    -0.677812757268
    2009-04-30 00:00:00    0.125061634713
    2009-05-29 00:00:00    0.979307492892
    2009-06-30 00:00:00    -1.2443243316
    2009-07-31 00:00:00    0.536260924391
    2009-08-31 00:00:00    0.060396849998
    2009-09-30 00:00:00    0.53784064627
    2009-10-30 00:00:00    -0.335999254912
    2009-11-30 00:00:00    -0.568216482894


If you add a Series to the frame, it will be automatically conformed
to the frame's index:

::

    >>> df['D'] = df['A'][:5]
    >>> df
    			   A              B              C              D
    2009-01-30 00:00:00    -0.367014      1.29942        1.40773        -0.367014
    2009-02-27 00:00:00    0.347326       0.651661       0.143376       0.347326
    2009-03-31 00:00:00    -0.677813      0.40488        -0.463113      -0.677813
    2009-04-30 00:00:00    0.125062       1.09505        -1.03278       0.125062
    2009-05-29 00:00:00    0.979307       0.149356       0.708128       0.979307
    2009-06-30 00:00:00    -1.24432       0.420788       -1.01815       nan
    2009-07-31 00:00:00    0.536261       -0.276357      -0.227469      nan
    2009-08-31 00:00:00    0.0603968      -1.42112       -0.271767      nan
    2009-09-30 00:00:00    0.537841       -0.361833      -0.0488729     nan
    2009-10-30 00:00:00    -0.335999      2.54742        -0.878263      nan
    2009-11-30 00:00:00    -0.568216      -0.557347      -1.58623       nan

Columns can be deleted or popped as with a dict:

::

    >>> del df['C']
    >>> B = df.pop('B')
    >>> df.info()
    Index: 11 entries, 2009-01-30 00:00:00 to 2009-11-30 00:00:00
    Columns:
    A    11  non-null values
    D    5  non-null values


New items in the DataFrame do not need to already be Series. They can
also be an ndarray of the right length or a scalar value:

::

    >>> df['N'] = np.arange(len(df))
    >>> df['S'] = 5
			   A              D              N              S
    2009-01-30 00:00:00    -0.367014      -0.367014      0              5
    2009-02-27 00:00:00    0.347326       0.347326       1              5
    2009-03-31 00:00:00    -0.677813      -0.677813      2              5
    2009-04-30 00:00:00    0.125062       0.125062       3              5
    2009-05-29 00:00:00    0.979307       0.979307       4              5
    2009-06-30 00:00:00    -1.24432       nan            5              5
    2009-07-31 00:00:00    0.536261       nan            6              5
    2009-08-31 00:00:00    0.0603968      nan            7              5
    2009-09-30 00:00:00    0.537841       nan            8              5
    2009-10-30 00:00:00    -0.335999      nan            9              5
    2009-11-30 00:00:00    -0.568216      nan            10             5

To be consistent with this dict-like interface, the *__contains__*
method considers the columns:

::

    >>> 'A' in df
    True

.. autosummary::
   :toctree: generated/

   DataFrame.__contains__
   DataFrame.__getitem__
   DataFrame.__delitem__
   DataFrame.pop

Retrieving cross sections, transposing
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

It is often desirable to retrieve all data associated with a
particular index values (we have been calling this a *cross
section*). Rather than use *__getitem__* and extra notation to do
this, DataFrame has the **getXS** method:

::

    >>> df.getXS(datetime(2009, 8, 31))
    A    0.060396849998
    D    nan
    N    7
    S    5

If the cross sections in a data set are of the most interest, it is
also possible to transpose a DataFrame using the same syntax as an
ndarray:

::

    >>> dftrans = df.T
    >>> dftrans
    <class 'pandas.core.frame.DataFrame'>
    Index: 4 entries, A to S
    Columns:
    2009-01-30 00:00:00    4  non-null values
    2009-02-27 00:00:00    4  non-null values
    2009-03-31 00:00:00    4  non-null values
    2009-04-30 00:00:00    4  non-null values
    2009-05-29 00:00:00    4  non-null values
    2009-06-30 00:00:00    3  non-null values
    2009-07-31 00:00:00    3  non-null values
    2009-08-31 00:00:00    3  non-null values
    2009-09-30 00:00:00    3  non-null values
    2009-10-30 00:00:00    3  non-null values
    2009-11-30 00:00:00    3  non-null values

    >>> dftrans[datetime(2009, 9, 30)]
    A    0.53784064627
    D    nan
    N    8
    S    5

Slicing ranges
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Similar to Python lists and ndarrays, for convenience DataFrame
supports slicing:

::

    >>> df[:2]
			   A              D              N              S
    2009-01-30 00:00:00    -0.367014      -0.367014      0              5
    2009-02-27 00:00:00    0.347326       0.347326       1              5

    >>> df[::-1]
			   A              D              N              S
    2009-11-30 00:00:00    -0.568216      nan            10             5
    2009-10-30 00:00:00    -0.335999      nan            9              5
    2009-09-30 00:00:00    0.537841       nan            8              5
    2009-08-31 00:00:00    0.0603968      nan            7              5
    2009-07-31 00:00:00    0.536261       nan            6              5
    2009-06-30 00:00:00    -1.24432       nan            5              5
    2009-05-29 00:00:00    0.979307       0.979307       4              5
    2009-04-30 00:00:00    0.125062       0.125062       3              5
    2009-03-31 00:00:00    -0.677813      -0.677813      2              5
    2009-02-27 00:00:00    0.347326       0.347326       1              5
    2009-01-30 00:00:00    -0.367014      -0.367014      0              5

    >>> df[-3:].T
	 2009-09-30     2009-10-30     2009-11-30
    A    0.537841       -0.335999      -0.568216
    D    nan            nan            nan
    N    8              9              10
    S    5              5              5

I do not recommend making heavy use of this functionality but rather
using it as a convenience for interactive programming (useful for
seeing the "head" or "tail" of a large DataFrame as in the last
example).

Boolean
~~~~~~~

As another indexing convenience, it is possible to use boolean
indexing to select rows of a DataFrame:

::

    >>> df[df['A'] > 0.5]
			   A              D              N              S
    2009-05-29 00:00:00    0.979307       0.979307       4              5
    2009-07-31 00:00:00    0.536261       nan            6              5
    2009-09-30 00:00:00    0.537841       nan            8              5

As we will see later on, the same operation could be accomplished by
reindexing. However, the syntax would be more verbose; hence, the
inclusion of this indexing method.

Arithmetic
----------

.. seealso:: :ref:`Series arithmetic <series.arithmetic>`

Binary operations with DataFrame have similar index-matching behavior
as with Series objects. The addition is the matching of column names
between DataFrame objects or Series. We will detail how the
interactions work in each case.

DataFrame and DataFrame
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

When combining two DataFrames, both index and column values must match
for two values to be combined. If there is no match for a particular
(index, column) pair, the result for that location will be NaN. To
illustrate, let's return to a similar example from the beginning of
the tutorial:

::

    >>> df
			   A              B              C

    >>> df + df[:7]

In this first example, we can see that the indices have been combined
together, and the portion where dates are missing in one of the frames
has resulted in all NaN values. The resulting columns will also be the
union of the frames' columns:

::

    >>> df2 = df.copy()
    >>> df2['D'] = 5
    >>> del df2['A']

    >>> df + df2[::2]
			   A              B              C              D
    2009-01-30 00:00:00    nan            -0.660108      4.91534        nan
    2009-02-27 00:00:00    nan            nan            nan            nan
    2009-03-31 00:00:00    nan            0.874588       1.25004        nan
    2009-04-30 00:00:00    nan            nan            nan            nan
    2009-05-29 00:00:00    nan            -3.10889       0.773488       nan
    2009-06-30 00:00:00    nan            nan            nan            nan
    2009-07-31 00:00:00    nan            -2.27803       1.69203        nan
    2009-08-31 00:00:00    nan            nan            nan            nan
    2009-09-30 00:00:00    nan            0.808167       1.17711        nan
    2009-10-30 00:00:00    nan            nan            nan            nan
    2009-11-30 00:00:00    nan            -0.0900043     -0.560404      nan

Here, neither **A** nor **D** was in both frames: they appear in the
result but are all NaN. An argument could be made to exclude these
columns, but it is very frequently meaningful to know that there was
no overlap in a particular portion of the data set.

DataFrame and Series
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The choice of behavior between DataFrame and Series was somewhat
arbitrary. Since the **columns** of the DataFrame are viewed as its
keys, and the **index** values of a Series are viewed as *its* keys,
the default behavior is to match the frame columns on the series
index.

::

    >>> df - df.getXS(df.index[5])
			   A              B              C

However, the user very frequently will want to subtract (or add,
divide, multiply, ...) a TimeSeries from a DataFrame representing a
collection of TimeSeries. Since this is so common, the DataFrame will
inspect the input Series and its own index to see if this is what the
user intended.

::

    >>> df - df['A']
			   A              B              C

Note that the same result could have been obtained by writing:

::

    >>> (df.T - df['A']).T

but this is fairly awkward (and relatively high cost due to two
transpose operations).

DataFrame and scalar value
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Scalar operations work just as expected:

::

    >>> df * 5 + 2
			   A              B              C
    2009-01-30 00:00:00    1.13256        0.349729       14.2884

Basic statistical functions
---------------------------

.. seealso:: :ref:`Series statistical methods <series.statistics>`

Being used to working with ndarrays, we would like to have the same
sorts of basic descriptive statistics implemented for
DataFrame. Additionally, and similar to NumPy MaskedArray objects,
these should be able to handle missing data.

An analogous set of methods to those in Series are provided to compute
common moments and other aggregate statistics. These come with the
addition that the aggregation can be over either axis of the
DataFrame. By default the statistic will be computed for each column
(axis 0):

::

    >>> df
			   A              B              C              D

The other methods listed function similarly. Combining these methods
with the arithmetic functionality, we can very easily do things like
computing the cross-sectional or time series z-score:

::

    >>> (df - df.mean(1)) / df.std(1)    # cross-sectional
			   A              B              C              D

    2009-02-27 00:00:00    -0.615664      1.47701        -0.245682      -0.615664
    ...

    >>> (df - df.mean()) / df.std()      # time series
			   A              B              C              D
    2009-01-30 00:00:00    -1.79314       -0.173077      0.156054       -0.96237
    2009-02-27 00:00:00    -1.16502       1.7612         -1.15894       -0.437405
    ...

Correlation
~~~~~~~~~~~

One related method computes the pairwise correlation of the columns,
taking care to compute the variances over the intersection of data:

::

    >>> df.corr()
	 A              B              C              D
    A    1              0.423766       -0.0985818     1
    B    0.423766       1              0.134803       0.839771
    C    -0.0985818     0.134803       1              0.129427
    D    1              0.839771       0.129427       1

Obviously other estimators of pairwise relationships could be computed
in the same way.

Function application
--------------------

You will often want to perform some other computation with the
DataFrame other than the statistical operators above. Likewise, you
may want to transform the data in some way (like taking the square
root or natural logarithm). To solve these problems, you should use
the **apply** function. In short, **apply** will call a function that
you pass on each row or column of the DataFrame and, depending on the
return type of the function, return a Series or DataFrame.

::

    >>> df.apply(np.log)
			   A              B              C

    2009-11-30 00:00:00    -1.12947529696

**apply** combined with some cleverness can be used to answer many
questions about a data set. For example, suppose we wanted to extract
the date where the maximum value for each column occurred:

::

    >>> df.apply(lambda x: df.index[x.valid().argmax()])
    A    2009-03-31 00:00:00
    B    2009-02-27 00:00:00
    C    2009-06-30 00:00:00

Another useful feature is the ability to pass Series methods to carry
out some Series operation on each columns or row:

::

    >>> df.apply(Series.interpolate)
    ...

applymap
~~~~~~~~

Since we don't always have vectorized functions to **apply**,
DataFrame has the method **applymap** which takes an elementwise
function. Obviously this will be fairly slow but can be useful:

::

    >>> df.applymap(lambda x: x if x > 0 else 0)
			   A              B              C              D

Of course you could have accomplished this using a vectorized NumPy
function:

::

    >>> df.apply(lambda x: np.where(x > 0, x, 0))
    ...

Iterating
---------

DataFrame's iterator functions are consistent with the dict interface:

::

    >>> for column in df:
    ....    print column
    A
    C
    B
    D

    >>> for column, series in df.iteritems():
    ...

   :toctree: generated/

   DataFrame.cols
   DataFrame.iteritems

Reindexing
----------

.. seealso:: :ref:`Series reindexing <series.reindexing>`

Similar to Series, the **reindex** method conforms a DataFrame to a
new index or list of columns.

   DataFrame.reindex
   DataFrame.dropEmptyRows
   DataFrame.dropIncompleteRows
   DataFrame.merge
   DataFrame.fill

DataFrame vs. DataMatrix
------------------------

DataFrame and DataMatrix differ only in their internal
implementation. In a nutshell:

  * DataFrame: dict of Series
  * DataMatrix: 2D homogeneous ndarray of values
